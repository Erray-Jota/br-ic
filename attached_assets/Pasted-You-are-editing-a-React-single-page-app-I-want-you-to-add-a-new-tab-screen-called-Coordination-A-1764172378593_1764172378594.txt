You are editing a React single-page app. I want you to add a new tab/screen called "Coordination – Architect" that shows how RaaP (Product Architect) and the AoR (Project Architect) share scope and sequencing during Entitlement and Permitting.

### High-level behavior

1. This screen should have:
   - A toggle at the top for **Entitlement** vs **Permitting**.
   - Below the toggle, a **grid of category tiles** (4–6 tiles depending on the selected phase).
   - When I click a tile, an **expanded detail panel** appears that shows:
     - The category name
     - RaaP scope + sequencing
     - AoR scope + sequencing

2. No backend changes needed. This is purely a front-end, data-driven component.

### Implementation details

1. **Create a new React component file** (or update the existing one if I already have it) for this tab, for example:

   `src/components/CoordinationArchitectTab.jsx`

2. In this component, use React state to track:
   - `phase`: `"entitlement"` or `"permitting"`
   - `selectedCategoryId`: `null` or the ID of the selected category

3. Define two **configuration arrays** inside the file:

   - `ENTITLEMENT_CATEGORIES`
   - `PERMITTING_CATEGORIES`

   Each category should look like this:

   ```js
   const ENTITLEMENT_CATEGORIES = [
     {
       id: "massing",
       label: "Massing & Building Form",
       icon: "🏗️", // placeholder emoji; I'll swap for real icons later
       raapScope: [
         "Provides core modular building logic (stacking rules, bay widths, length increments).",
         "Supplies unit prototypes and allowable combinations.",
         "Defines DfMA constraints that shape massing options."
       ],
       raapSequencing: [
         "Delivered Day 0–14 as the fixed product baseline.",
         "Used immediately by the AoR for site fit studies."
       ],
       aorScope: [
         "Tests massing against zoning envelopes, setbacks, and height limits.",
         "Adjusts building orientation and placement on the site.",

       ],
       aorSequencing: [
         "Weeks 2–6: entitlement moves forward in parallel.",
         "Refines massing as entitlement decisions evolve."
       ]
     },
     {
       id: "site-zoning",
       label: "Site Fit & Zoning",

       ],
       raapSequencing: [

       ],

         "Develops site plans, setbacks, and access points.",

       ],
       aorSequencing: [

       label: "Early Code & Life Safety",
       icon: "📘",
       raapScope: [
         "Provides prototype IBC-based code matrix.",
         "Supplies standard egress concepts and travel distance assumptions.",
         "Provides ADA-compliant prototype unit layouts (not site paths)."
       ],
       raapSequencing: [
         "Delivered as part of the Product Kit in Days 0–14."
       ],
       aorScope: [
         "Localizes egress, fire separations, and rated walls.",
         "Establishes preliminary life-safety strategy for entitlement.",
         "Evaluates local amendments and overlays onto RaaP logic."
       ],
       aorSequencing: [
         "Weeks 2–6: code approach refined for agency input."
       ]
     },
     {

       label: "Early Cost & Feasibility",
       icon: "💰",
       raapScope: [
         "Provides modular vs site-built comparative costs.",
         "Defines factory vs GC scope split.",
         "Validates feasibility via DfMA constraints and productized design."
       ],
       raapSequencing: [
         "Generates early cost and feasibility within the first 1–2 weeks."
       ],
       aorScope: [
         "Confirms entitlement decisions align with modular feasibility.",
         "Incorporates cost-aware design into site plans and massing.",
         "Aligns entitlement drawings with factory realities."
       ],
       aorSequencing: [
         "Continuous feedback during Weeks 2–6."
       ]
     }
   ];
