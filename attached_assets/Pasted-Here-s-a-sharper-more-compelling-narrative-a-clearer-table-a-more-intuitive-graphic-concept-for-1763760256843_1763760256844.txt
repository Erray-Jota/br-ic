Here’s a sharper, more compelling narrative + a clearer table + a more intuitive graphic concept for the Build Time tab, using ONLY the data in the PDF you uploaded .

I’m keeping this focused, high-signal, and easy for you to drop straight into the app.
If anything feels off, I can tune it.

1. Stronger Narrative (Short, Punchy, Developer-Focused)
RaaP cuts 4 months from design and 6 months from construction by removing the “dead time” in traditional workflows.

Traditional development forces a strict sequence:
Design → Entitlements → Permit Docs → Permitting → Construction.
Each step waits for the one before it. The clock runs. Nothing moves.

RaaP collapses the sequence.

How RaaP reduces Design Time (4 months saved)

SmartStart gives developers permit-ready prototypes upfront—so entitlement reviewers evaluate a real building from day one.

EasyDesign begins before entitlements finish, because 80% of the drawings are standardized and already factory-validated.

AoR focuses only on site-specific sheets, not reinventing the entire building.

Result:
RaaP’s design + entitlement path = 21 months
Traditional = 25 months
➡️ 4-month reduction without skipping any required approvals.

How RaaP reduces Construction Time (6 months saved)

RaaP shifts the long pole: instead of waiting for permits to start construction, modules are fabricated in parallel while the GC mobilizes on-site.

FabAssure (13 months) ensures the fabricator + GC are selected & aligned before permit issuance.

Fabricator produces modules in a fixed 4-month factory window.

GC overlaps with fabrication (8 months).

Together: 14-month path
Traditional construction: 20 months (Feb 2028 → Mar 2029)
➡️ 6 months saved after permits—the fastest path to revenue.

2. Cleaner, Developer-Facing Timeline Table
Side-by-Side Timeline: RaaP vs Traditional
Design + Permitting
Phase	RaaP	Traditional	Difference
Conceptual / SmartStart	2 months	3 months	RaaP faster (1 mo)
Entitlements	12 months	12 months	Same
Permit Docs	2 months (EasyDesign)	7 months	RaaP faster (5 mo)
Permitting	5 months	5 months	Same
Total Design Duration	21 months	25 months	4 months saved
Construction
Phase	RaaP	Traditional	Difference
FabAssure (Pre-construction)	13 months	—	—
Fabricator (Modules)	4 months	—	—
GC On-Site	8 months	14 months	RaaP cuts onsite time nearly in half
Total Construction Duration	14 months	20 months	6 months saved

Total RaaP Advantage:
➡️ 10 months faster overall (4 months faster design + 6 months faster delivery)

3. Stronger Graphic Concept (Way More Intuitive)

Here is a narrative + layout that works perfectly as a visual in your app:

Graphic Title:
📊 Parallelized Timeline: How RaaP Compresses 31 Months into 21
Graphic Layout (Text Description for Your Designer / HTML)

A. Two Horizontal Timeline Bars

Top Bar – Traditional (31 months)

Long sequential blocks:

Conceptual Design (3 mo)
→ Entitlements (12 mo)
→ Permit Docs (7 mo)
→ Permitting (5 mo)
→ Construction (20 mo)
TOTAL: 47 months
(But your building PDF’s totals show 25 + 20 = 45; use the real numbers: 25 months design + 20 months construction = 45 months total)

Use a long red bar stretching across the screen.

Bottom Bar – RaaP (21 months)

Overlapping blocks stacked visually:

SmartStart (2 mo)

Entitlements (12 mo)

EasyDesign (2 mo overlapping with last month of entitlements)

FabAssure (13 mo overlapping with EasyDesign)

Fabricator (4 mo starting before permits)

GC On-Site (8 mo overlapping with Fabricator)
TOTAL: 21 months

Use green bars of different shades to show overlap.

C. Center Callout Bubble: “10 Months Saved”

Placed between the two bars with an arrow pointing from Traditional → RaaP.
Color: gold/yellow.

D. Simple Explanation Under the Graphic

“RaaP unlocks overlap that isn’t possible in traditional construction.
Design and construction run in parallel—not in sequence—removing 10 months of dead time.”
