PHASE 1: FEASIBILITY & PRICE
SmartStart: Know in 2 Weeks, Save 20x.
Turn your vision into a modular-ready project with firm pricing and a conceptual design optimized for fabrication.

SmartStart vs. Traditional Feasibility
Metric	RaaP SmartStart	Status Quo
Investment	✓ $10K Flat Fee	✗ $50K - $150K soft costs
Design Focus	✓ Factory Optimized Conceptual Design	✗ Often Designed for Stick-Build
Pricing Detail	✓ Firm Bids (3-5 GCs/Fabs)	✗ Rough Estimates (±20% Extrapolation)
Outputs	✓ Entitlement & Funding Ready Package	✗ Requires major Rework for Coordination
SmartStart pays for itself 10–20× on the factory side alone.

PHASE 2: PARTNER SELECTION & AWARD
FabAssure: Risk & Cost Mitigation.
Confidently select the right fabricator and manage the contract process to lock in quality, scope, and price.

FabAssure vs. Traditional Sourcing
Metric	RaaP FabAssure	Status Quo
Selection Criteria	✓ Detailed 4-Factor Evaluation (Viability, Price, Quality, Design)	✗ Limited Vetting; High Risk of Misalignment
Scope Alignment	✓ RaaP Manages Scope/Term Negotiation for modular core	✗ Direct Negotiation; Risk of Missed Scope
Payment Model	✓ Paid from Savings, Not Upfront	✗ Standard Consulting Fees (Upfront)
Outcome	✓ Saves Millions, Reduces RFIs & Submittals	✗ Cost Creep & Execution Risk
We don't get fully paid unless you save real dollars.

PHASE 3: DESIGN & PERMITTING
EasyDesign: Fixed Price Architecture.
A Product Architecture Package defining the design, performance, and factory-ready details for your modular core.

EasyDesign vs. Traditional Architecture
Metric	RaaP EasyDesign	Status Quo
Modular Core	✓ 80% Factory Permit Set	✗ Standard Design (Needs Factory Rework)
AHJ Submission	✓ ~40% of AHJ Permit Set Completed	✗ Modular Details Must be Re-engineered
Efficiency	✓ Eliminates Factory Rework & Saves Design Fees	✗ High Rework/RFI Rate During Fabrication
Costing	✓ Fixed Fee developed with AoR	✗ Hourly/Percentage Fees; Uncertain Final Cost
Reduces overall design fees & speeds delivery by optimizing for modularity first.
