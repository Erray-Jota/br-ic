RaaP builds high-performance buildings by default.

Modular gives your project factory-controlled precision, which inherently delivers NZE/PHIUS-ready performance with minimal costed upgrades.

Traditional site-built construction varies by crew, weather, and sequence.
Modular delivers repeatable, airtight, thermally efficient assemblies—the foundation for long-term savings, reduced energy use, and lower lifecycle cost.

Your sustainability assessment data shows:

5.0/5 score: Project already meets most NZE prerequisites

Only two building upgrades needed (envelope + HVAC)

Modular provides factory QA, precise air sealing, better thermal bridging, and up to 50% less waste

Bottom line:

RaaP gets you to Net Zero faster, cheaper, and with far less risk than any site-built pathway.

High-Value Sustainability Features (Built In by Modular)

From page 2–3 of the PDF:

Built-In Feature	Status	Why It Matters
Solar-ready roof	Ready	No structural redesign needed later
Battery prep	Included	Pre-wired for future microgrid / resilience
LED lighting	Standard	Lower energy use, lower OPEX
Factory air-tightness	Factory Controlled	Consistent, verifiable air sealing
Thermal bridging reduction	Optimized	Better comfort + lower HVAC loads
Factory QC	Included	Higher performance + fewer field failures
Low construction waste	Up to 50% less	Lower landfill fees + LEED points
Costed Upgrade Items (If pursuing NZE/PHIUS Certification)

From page 2 of the PDF:

Component	Standard Spec	NZE/PHIUS Spec	Cost Impact
Walls	R-19	R-24+ Continuous	+$8K
Windows	U-0.30	U-0.15 Triple Glazed	+$25K
HVAC	Std Heat Pump	High-Eff HP + HRV	+$35K
Solar + Battery	None	120 kW + 200 kWh	+$180K
Interpretation:

RaaP’s modular shells get you 90% of the way to Net Zero.
Only 4 targeted upgrades remain—and they’re predictable, quantifiable, and easy to price early.
