Subtext (smaller):
$40K–$90K in immediate savings + 10–20× ROI on factory-side optimization.

🔥 If You Want a More Philosophical Punch (optional)

Put this right below the banner:

**Developers fail modular projects for two reasons: bad pricing and bad design.

SmartStart fixes both — before they can hurt you.**
